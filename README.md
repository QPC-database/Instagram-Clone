# React Instagram Clone

This repository contains a reactive single-page application that aims to mimic the look, feel, and functionality of Instagram. This App uses firebase as the primary DataBase Tool. Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. Firebase provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, creating marketing and product experiment. For the buttons and other styling components material-ui was made use of. Material Design is an Android-oriented design language created by Google, supporting onscreen touch experiences via cue-rich features and natural motions that mimic real-world objects. This project still needs work.
